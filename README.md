# BOINC on Heroku

This is a simple app that deploys to a Heroku dyno to work on Universe@Home, supporting free plans. Be aware that this currently contributes to my account.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

**Note:** You may have to scale the worker dyno to 1.

## Todo
These things can be improved. I may add them in my spare time, but feel free to send a Pull Request.
